HUGU: a comprehensive database of human gingival unique genes

The gingiva of the mouth or gum, the tissue of the upper and lower jaws that encircles the base of the teeth, is home to a diverse colony of bacteria. The processing of data from the gum microbiome samples is difficult and sometimes requires a lot of computing resources. Using a curated collection of non-human genes from microbial and viral species that live in human gum can make these analyses easier to handle. We cataloged a comprehensive database of human gum unique genes (HUGU). HUGU database is comprehensive and contains more than 1,500,000 unique microbial and viral genes. An extensive taxonomic annotation scheme has been applied to the gene catalog. Additionally, we developed gingival orthologous clusters using HUGU. HUGU and its accompanying orthologous clusters were made with a focus on genes. This makes them an easy-to-use tool for describing the composition and biological function of human gum microbiome samples. HUGU is a database and set of tools that makes it easy to comprehend the role of gum bacteria in human health.
